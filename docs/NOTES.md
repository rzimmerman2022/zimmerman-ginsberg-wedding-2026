## Decision Points

### Guest Count Strategy

Current numbers:
- Jordyn's side: 30 minimum
- Ryan's side: 15-20 estimated
- Combined consideration: 28 adults + 5 kids = 33 total

**Questions to resolve:**
1. What is the total target guest count?
2. How does the "combined 28 + 5 kids" relate to the individual side counts?
3. What is the "30 people have to have" requirement about?
4. Are Jared and Alfredo included in current counts or additions?

**Impact on planning:**
- Venue capacity requirements
- Budget (cost per guest)
- Invitation count
- Seating arrangements
- Catering minimums
