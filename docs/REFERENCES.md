## Research Quality Assurance

### Cross-Validation Methodology

1. **Timeline Data:** Minimum 3 sources for each vendor booking window
2. **Industry Standards:** Validated against gold standard sources (The Knot, Zola, WeddingWire)

4. **Professional Sources:** All sources from established industry professionals
5. **Recency:** All sources reviewed/updated within 2024-2025

### Data Conflicts Resolution

When sources provided conflicting timelines:
- **Preference given to:** Most recent publication
- **Validation through:** Gold standard sources (The Knot, Zola, WeddingWire)
- **Conservative approach:** Recommended earlier booking when in doubt
- **Range reporting:** When consensus unclear, provided range (e.g., "9-12 months")

- Individual blog posts without professional credentials
- Outdated information (pre-2020, except for evergreen content)
- Sources without clear authorship or organizational backing

- Daylight savings time impact (earlier sunset)
- Holiday travel patterns (Thanksgiving)
- Weather considerations (temperature, precipitation)
