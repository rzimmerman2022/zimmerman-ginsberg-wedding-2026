## Guest List Tips

### Creating Your List

2. Add close friends you can't imagine not having there
3. Add extended family
4. Add other friends and colleagues
5. Review together and make cuts if needed

### Difficult Decisions
- **The B-List**: Create a secondary list of people to invite if you get declines
- **Children**: Decide on a policy (no kids, kids welcome, family only)
- **Plus Ones**: Establish a rule (engaged/married only, long-term relationships, everyone)
- **Coworkers**: All or none, or just close work friends?

### Address Collection
- Use your networks (parents, siblings, friends)
- Facebook events for address collection
- Create Google Form for easy address submission
- Wedding website with address collection form

### RSVP Tracking
- Set RSVP deadline 3-4 weeks before wedding
- Follow up on non-responses 1 week after deadline
- Update spreadsheet immediately as RSVPs arrive
- Provide caterer with final count by their deadline
