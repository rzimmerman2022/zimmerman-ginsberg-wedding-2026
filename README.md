# Zimmerman-Ginsberg Wedding 2026 Planning Toolkit
*Generated by gpt-5-codex-high on 2025-11-22 09:19:18 UTC.*

## Purpose
This repository keeps a clean, versioned source of truth for wedding planning: guest tracking, metrics, vendors, budget, and venue exploration. The CSVs are ready to paste into Google Sheets/Excel or feed into light automation. Everything should carry clear metadata and stay auditable via git.

## Repository Layout
- `wedding_guest_list.csv` — Master guest roster with invite/save-the-date/RSVP fields plus attendance across events.
- `wedding_metrics_summary.csv` — Snapshot metrics (counts for sides, adults/kids, invites/RSVPs, timeline).
- `wedding_metrics_registry.csv` — NEW: authoritative metric definitions, owners, targets, and current values.
- `wedding_vendor_tracker.csv` — Vendor contact log and status.
- `wedding_budget_tracker.csv` — Budget categories with estimated vs. actual and payment checkpoints.
- `Wedding_Venue_Master_Ryan_Jordyn_2026.xlsx` — Venue research workbook.
- `Gmail - Top 2 Wedding venues to check out.pdf` — Reference PDF from venue outreach.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Human-readable history of notable changes.

## Data Standards
- Dates: ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`); timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ`.
- Status fields: use consistent enums (e.g., `Not Sent`, `Pending`, `Yes`, `No`, `Not Contacted`, `Contacted`, `Booked`).
- Guest sides: `Jordyn`, `Ryan`, or `Both`.
- Adults/Kids: mark `Number_Adults` and `Number_Children` explicitly to keep counts accurate.
- Metadata: every new file or change authored by the model should note `gpt-5-codex-high` and timestamp in the header or top rows.

## Quick Start
1) Open the CSVs in Sheets/Excel; keep the headers intact.  
2) Populate guest rows (Jordyn ≈30 adults; Ryan ≈15–20 adults; combined snapshot currently 28 adults + 5 kids).  
3) Update invite and RSVP fields as communication goes out; metrics will roll up from those values.  
4) Track vendors and budget items as quotes and contracts arrive.  
5) Commit changes with concise messages (e.g., `git add ...` then `git commit -m "Update guest RSVPs (Jordyn side)"`).

## Metrics Guidance
- Use `wedding_metrics_registry.csv` to define each metric (owner, formula, cadence, target).
- Keep `wedding_metrics_summary.csv` as the live numbers; update `Current_Value` and `Last_Updated` whenever counts change.
- Sample pivots in Sheets/Excel:
  - Adults: `=COUNTIFS(Number_Adults,">0")`
  - Kids: `=COUNTIFS(Number_Children,">0")`
  - Jordyn side: `=COUNTIFS(Guest_Side,"Jordyn")`
  - Ryan side: `=COUNTIFS(Guest_Side,"Ryan")`
  - RSVP Yes: `=COUNTIFS(Attending_Status,"Yes")`

## Version Control Practices
- Branch: main (no commits yet). Use `git status` before/after edits.
- Always include model and timestamp in new/updated files you author.
- Keep binary files (PDF/XLSX) tracked only if needed; otherwise add to `.gitignore`.
- Commit in small, meaningful slices (docs vs. data vs. formulas).

## Operational Checkpoints
- Set RSVP deadline once venue and invite timeline are fixed.
- Confirm venue capacity vs. current headcount (28 adults + 5 kids initial snapshot).
- Reconcile budget (`wedding_budget_tracker.csv`) with vendor quotes as they arrive.
- Keep contact cadence in `wedding_vendor_tracker.csv` (meeting/follow-up dates).

## Next Steps (suggested)
- Fill the guest list with names and sides, then refresh `wedding_metrics_summary.csv`.
- Add priority vendors with initial outreach dates in `wedding_vendor_tracker.csv`.
- Establish budget targets per category in `wedding_budget_tracker.csv`.
