## My Professional Take

Given that you're:
- Data-driven (this project shows it!)
- Budget-conscious (smart move)
- Based in Phoenix area

**Recommendation:**
Start with **IronOaks (Chandler)** and **Colby Falls (Gilbert)** tours. If both feel "meh," then tour **Clayton House (Scottsdale)** as the premium option. Keep Sedona as a backup only if you're willing to double the budget and your guest list is under 100.

The math: You save $32K by staying in East Valley. That's a honeymoon, a house down payment, or your first year of marriage without financial stress.
