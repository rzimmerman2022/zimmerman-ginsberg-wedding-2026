## About The Knot: Is It Reputable?

### TL;DR on The Knot's Reputation
**For Couples (You):** ✅ Reputable and useful  
**For Vendors:** ⚠️ Mixed reviews (not your concern)

### What You Need to Know

**The Good (For Couples Planning Weddings):**
- 13+ million monthly visitors - largest wedding planning platform
- Free planning tools, checklists, and vendor discovery
- Merged with WeddingWire (now owns both)
- Helpful for organization, guest management, and timeline planning
- Generally positive reviews from couples using it to plan
- Excellent vendor search and comparison features

**The Concerns:**
- Parent company (The Knot Worldwide) has "F" BBB rating
  - BUT: This is almost entirely due to vendor complaints about advertising costs
  - NOT about couples' experience using the planning tools
- Some reports of vendor review manipulation
  - Vendors claim negative reviews sometimes get removed
  - **Action Item:** Cross-reference vendor reviews on multiple sites (Google, Yelp, WeddingWire)
- Website occasionally glitches (minor technical issues)

**Bottom Line for Your Planning:**
✅ **Safe to use** for:
- Venue discovery and research
- Budget planning tools
- Guest list management
- Vendor search (but verify reviews elsewhere)
- Wedding website creation
- Planning checklists

❌ **Don't rely solely on** for:
- Vendor reviews - always cross-check on Google, Yelp, WeddingWire
- Final vendor decisions - do your own research and interviews

**Verdict:** The Knot is legitimate and useful for wedding planning. Use it as one tool in your toolkit, not your only source. The negative reviews are from vendors who paid for advertising, not from couples planning weddings.
