## Tips for Success

### Communication
- **Be a team**: Make big decisions together
- **Regular check-ins**: Set aside dedicated planning time
- **Divide tasks**: Play to each other's strengths
- **Stay aligned**: Review the decision log together regularly

### Budget
- **Track everything**: Every expense, no matter how small
- **Build buffer**: Aim to spend 90% of budget (10% buffer for surprises)
- **Prioritize**: Know your top 3 budget priorities
- **Question everything**: Ask vendors what's included vs. extra

### Stress Management
- **One thing at a time**: Don't try to do everything at once
- **Delegate**: Accept help from wedding party and family
- **Take breaks**: Schedule wedding-free days/weeks
- **Remember the why**: It's about marriage, not just a wedding

### Decision Making
- **Trust your gut**: If something feels off, it probably is
- **Don't settle**: This is a once-in-a-lifetime event
- **Ask questions**: No question is too small or silly
- **Get it in writing**: All agreements, changes, promises

## Common First-Month Questions

**Q: What should we do first?**  
A: Set budget, create guest list, and start venue research. Everything else flows from these.

**Q: How do we know if we're on track?**  
A: Check the timeline.md file for your current phase (12-18 months before). If you're completing tasks in that section, you're on track.

**Q: When should we book vendors?**  
A: Venue first (now), then photographer/caterer/florist/entertainment (9-11 months before), then everything else.

**Q: How much should we spend on [X]?**  
A: See the budget-breakdown.md percentages, but adjust based on your priorities. No wedding is exactly the same.

**Q: What if we're behind schedule?**  
A: Don't panic! Wedding planning is flexible. Focus on the must-haves (venue, caterer, photographer) and work through the rest systematically.
